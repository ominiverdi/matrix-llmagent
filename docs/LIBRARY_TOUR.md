# Welcome to the OSGeo Library

This is a searchable collection of scientific documents on cartography, map projections, and geospatial science. The collection includes classic reference works with their figures, tables, and equations extracted for easy access.

## What's in the Collection

The library focuses on:
- **Map Projections** - theory, mathematics, and practical applications
- **Cartography** - principles of map-making and visualization
- **Geodesy** - the shape of the Earth and coordinate systems
- **Historical Works** - classic texts from the USGS and other institutions

Documents include the full text plus extracted visual elements you can view directly.

## How to Search

Ask questions in natural language:
- "What is the Mercator projection?"
- "Show me equations for conformal mapping"
- "Find figures about conic projections"
- "What did Snyder write about equal-area projections?"

The search is semantic - it understands meaning, not just keywords.

## Understanding Results

Search results come in different types:
- **Text passages** - excerpts from documents with page references
- **Figures** - maps, diagrams, charts, portraits
- **Tables** - data, projection parameters, comparisons
- **Equations** - mathematical formulas rendered cleanly

Each result shows which document and page it comes from.

## Viewing Images and Pages

After a search, you can explore further:
- `show 3` - Display the image for result #3 (figures, tables, equations)
- `sources` - List all sources from the last search with page numbers
- `source 2` - View the full page for source #2
- `next` / `prev` - Navigate forward/back through a document
- `page 45` - Jump to a specific page

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: "Lambert conformal conic projection" works better than "projections"
- **Ask about figures**: "show me Figure 24 from the Snyder manual"
- **Explore by topic**: "equations for calculating scale factor"
- **Browse a document**: Once you find something interesting, use page navigation to explore the surrounding context

## Quick Command Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `!l <query>` | Direct library search (no AI) |
| `show N` | View image for result N |
| `sources` | List sources from last search |
| `source N` | View full page for source N |
| `next` / `prev` | Navigate pages |
| `page N` | Jump to page N |

## Getting Started

Try one of these to begin:
- "What map projections preserve area?"
- "Show me the equations for the transverse Mercator"
- "Find figures showing projection distortion"

The library is here to help you explore the science of mapping.
